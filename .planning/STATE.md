# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Architecture decision (TemplateLanguage vs. injection-into-HTML) must be locked in Phase 1 before any grammar work — wrong choice is expensive to reverse
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Python plugin dependency should use `com.intellij.modules.python` (bundled module), NOT `com.jetbrains.python` (Marketplace plugin)
- [Pre-Phase 1]: GrammarKit Gradle plugin version must be verified at plugins.gradle.org before pinning — training data version may be stale
- [01-01]: Use pycharmCommunity() target — IDE is PyCharm Community, not IntelliJ IDEA
- [01-01]: GrammarKit tasks are commented stubs — .flex/.bnf files don't exist until Phase 2; activating now causes Gradle config errors
- [01-01]: org.gradle.java.home pinned to JDK 21 — IntelliJ Platform instrumentCode fails on Windows with JDK 25 (no Packages/ dir in MSI-installed JDK)
- [01-01]: platformBundledPlugins = PythonCore for bundled Python support in PyCharm Community
- [01-01]: plugin.xml name = Mako Template Support (marketplace branding)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: JFlex filter expression handling (`${x | h,trim}`) needs a lexer design spike in Phase 2 — `|` disambiguation from Python bitwise OR not fully resolved
- [Research]: TemplateDataLanguageConfigurable exact API for platform build 252 needs verification against current documentation before Phase 4
